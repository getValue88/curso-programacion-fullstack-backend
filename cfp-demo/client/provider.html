                            Providers are a fundamental concept in Nest. Many of the basic Nest classes may be treated
                            as a provider â€“ services, repositories, factories, helpers, and so on. The main idea of a
                            provider is that it can inject dependencies; this means objects can create various
                            relationships with each other, and the function of "wiring up" instances of objects can
                            largely be delegated to the Nest runtime system. A provider is simply a class annotated with
                            an @Injectable() decorator.

                            Nest is built around the strong design pattern commonly known as Dependency injection.

                            In Nest, thanks to TypeScript capabilities, it's extremely easy to manage dependencies
                            because they are resolved just by type.

                            Nest will resolve a service by creating and returning an instance of this service (or, in
                            the normal case of
                            a singleton, returning the existing instance if it has already been requested elsewhere).
                            This dependency is resolved and passed to controller's constructor (or assigned to the
                            indicated property).
